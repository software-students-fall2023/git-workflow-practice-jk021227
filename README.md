The article itself really caught my eye because it seemed like a pretty *controversial* opinion, especially with a rise of CS majors as 
the field grows. The first example that the article makes is about hiring physicists and mathematicians for work rather than CS majors 
in which they stated that the former are "more practical and focused on getting the machines to deliver". This example made me want to 
continue the article to see what they were really talking about.The explanation to this claim is that CS majors are obsessed with 
theory and that it does not matter whether a problem is NP-complete but that we solve them as the real world requires answers to a 
problem rather than how hard it is to solve them. In addition, when working on real-life projects, the **functionality** and 
**simplicity** of 
code should be prioritized rather than adding creative bits and pieces to the code. This becomes a problem especially when you are 
working with a team wherein they all would have to learn an odd feature that you decide to add to the code base, siginificantly slowing 
down the process of the project etc. 

The rest of the article also bring up pretty interesting points especially on about the **complacency** of some CS professors who are 
potentially out of touch with the ever-evolving field of CS on top of critisizing the CS courses offered as requirments. One example 
that stood out to me in this is *Data Structures*. They mention that it is very unlikely in the real world that you would have to 
maneuver around to figure out the "best" data structure to implement or even have to implement your own as that is prone to mistakes 
and unnecessarily time-consuming: *"Many organizations explicitly forbid roll-your-own data structures with good reason."* Although 
there 
are points that are not always true, I think this is a pretty interesting article that gives a refreshing insight about CS as a form of 
academia and in the real world.
